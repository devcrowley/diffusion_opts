## Development Philosophy

### Iterative Development Approach
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic profiling, add complexity incrementally
- **Validate Early**: Test each component before moving to the next phase
- **Fail Fast**: Identify issues quickly and adjust approach
- **Measure Everything**: Comprehensive metrics at each stage

### Risk Management Strategy
- **Fallback Systems**: Always maintain working fallbacks to full model
- **Quality Gates**: No phase progression without meeting quality thresholds
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish benchmarks before optimization
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards for future extensibility

### Hypothesis Alignment
All milestones map to validation hypotheses defined in the whitepaper (H1–H5):
- **H1 (Head Pruning Feasibility)**: Addressed in Phase 1 Week 2–3 (profiling + simulation) & Week 4 (report)
- **H2 (VRAM Reduction vs Quality)**: Evaluated end of Phase 1 and refined in Phase 2 Weeks 7–8
- **H3 (Reuse Across Paraphrases)**: Initial probe in Phase 2 Weeks 9–10; expanded in Phase 3 Advanced Caching
- **H4 (Batch Throughput Speedup)**: Measured at Phase 2 completion and optimized Phase 3 Weeks 15–20
- **H5 (Amortization Threshold)**: Calculated in Phase 1 Week 4; re-validated after caching (Phase 2 Week 12)

Progression gates depend on meeting threshold metrics for corresponding hypotheses (see Success Metrics section).
