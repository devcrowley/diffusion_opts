# Dynamic Diffusion Model Optimization: Prompt-Specific Fragment Loading

**A Technical Whitepaper on Memory-Efficient AI Image Generation**

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a novel approach to optimizing large diffusion models for consumer hardware by dynamically extracting and caching prompt-specific model fragments. The proposed system would enable running massive diffusion models (>24GB) on consumer GPUs through intelligent memory management and usage-based model compilation.

## Problem Statement

Current state-of-the-art diffusion models are becoming increasingly large, with some models exceeding the memory capacity of even high-end consumer GPUs (24GB). This creates a barrier for researchers and developers working with limited hardware resources.

### Current Limitations
- **Memory Constraints**: Models like large Stable Diffusion variants can exceed 24GB VRAM
- **Inefficient Loading**: Entire models are loaded regardless of prompt requirements
- **Batch Generation**: Multiple variations of the same prompt require full model reloading
- **Consumer Hardware Gap**: Growing disparity between model requirements and consumer GPU capabilities

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept: Prompt-Specific Model Fragments

The fundamental insight is that **not all model weights are needed for every prompt**. Different concepts, objects, and styles activate different portions of the neural network.

#### Three-Phase Approach:

1. **Profile Phase**: Generate one image while monitoring which model components are actively used
2. **Extract Phase**: Create a smaller, optimized model containing only the used components
3. **Generate Phase**: Use the optimized fragment for rapid batch generation with different seeds

### Technical Architecture

```
System Memory (64GB)
├── Full Model Storage (20-100GB+)
├── Fragment Cache (Multiple optimized models)
└── Analysis Engine

GPU Memory (24GB)
├── Active Fragment (8-15GB)
├── Working Tensors (4-8GB)
└── Output Buffers (2-4GB)
```

#### Memory Flow Pattern:
```
[Full Model in RAM] → [Profile Analysis] → [Fragment Extraction] → [GPU Cache] → [Fast Generation]
     ^                      ^                      ^                    ^              ^
  One-time load         Per prompt            Per prompt         Per session    Per variation
```

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| H1  | A single multi-seed profiling run identifies ≥30% prunable attention heads for a prompt family with negligible quality loss | Remove lowest-energy heads (20–40%), compare CLIP text-image similarity & perceptual metrics vs full model | <2% average CLIP drop; LPIPS Δ <0.03  | Increase seeds, aggregate multiple prompts, relax pruning % |

| H3  | Fragment reused for paraphrased prompts (embedding cosine ≥0.9) preserves quality                                           | Embed paraphrases, reuse fragment, compare metrics                                                         | ≥80% prompts within H2 quality bounds | Maintain per-cluster union fragment                         |

### Experiment Design Overview
1. Profiling Run: 8–16 seeds, subset of diffusion steps (e.g., 10 of 50) to approximate head importance quickly.
2. Importance Scoring: Composite of mean activation energy, variance, and (optional) entropy of attention distributions.
3. Pruning Simulation: First simulate by masking heads (logical pruning) → evaluate metrics. If acceptable, physically rebuild attention projection matrices (physical pruning) and re-measure.
4. Fragment Materialization: Export reduced state_dict (heads removed, optional low-rank factors) + metadata (original model hash, pruning mask, thresholds, profiling stats).
5. Reuse Test: Prompt paraphrase set (e.g., 5 variants) selected via text encoder embedding similarity. Re-run generation.
6. Metrics Collected: CLIP similarity, LPIPS (if available), SSIM, simple perceptual hash distance, latency, peak VRAM, fragment disk footprint.

### Go / No-Go Criteria (Early Prototype)
Proceed to channel-level or deeper structural pruning only if: (a) H1, H2, H4 pass; (b) quality gates met (<5% degradation). Otherwise pivot to precision / low-rank adaptation strategy.

## Phase 1.1: Refined Early Milestone (Head Pruning Pilot)

Focused scope delivering the minimal “fragment” concept using ONLY attention head pruning + optional low-rank compression (no channel excision). This de-risks structural complexity while showing tangible gains.

### Objectives
- Implement activation & attention profiling hooks.
- Derive head importance ranking across multi-seed runs.
- Simulate vs physical pruning comparison.
- Produce a reusable fragment (mask + reduced weight tensors) and measure speed / VRAM impact.

### Deliverables
| Artifact          | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Profiling Dataset | JSON/Parquet with per-head stats across seeds & steps |
| Pruning Report    | Before/after metrics (VRAM, latency, quality)         |
| Fragment Package  | state_dict + metadata + pruning manifest              |
| Reuse Evaluation  | Metrics table for paraphrased prompts                 |

### Timeline (Approx. 2 Weeks)
Week 1: Hooks, data capture, scoring, masking simulation.
Week 2: Physical pruning implementation, fragment export, evaluation, reuse & amortization analysis.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Over-pruning early: Start at 15–20% head removal; escalate only if metrics stable.
- Sampling bias: Use multiple seeds + partial step sampling; confirm with one full-step verification run.
- Minimal VRAM savings: Combine pruning with selective 4–8 bit quantization for least-important retained heads.
